This application performs customer classification for a mall using the KMeans algorithm. The model helps businesses understand different customer segments based on features like age, annual income, and spending score.

## Overview

The application uses the `mall_customers.csv` dataset to train a KMeans model and segment customers into distinct groups. It leverages machine learning techniques to identify patterns and provide insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Features

- User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
- Input form to explore different customer segments.
- Real-time visualization of customer clusters.
- Accessible via Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Dataset

The application is trained on the **mall_customers.csv** dataset, which includes features like:

- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training and evaluation.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading machine learning models.

## Model

The predictive model is trained using the KMeans algorithm. It applies preprocessing steps like creating dummy variables, using elbow method to find the best k value. The model aims to segment customers into clusters based on their annual income and spending score.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding support for additional datasets.
- Incorporating more advanced clustering algorithms.
- Adding visualizations to better represent customer segments.

## Installation (for local deployment)
